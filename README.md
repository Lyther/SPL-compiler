# SPL-compiler
 Use Flex and Bison to transfer SPL to syntax tree, and do some grammar analysis.
 Note that the current version is still a little buggy, I'll fix it as soon as possible.

Usage:
Run the Makefile using specify settings, and the executable file would be
	in ./bin/splc, and you should input a file as argument to the program.
Example: ./bin/splc test.sql
Then the syntax tree or tokens would be printed to test.out file.

Makefile:
1. make flex
	Only generate a lexical analyzer, and transfer source code into tokens.
2. make main
	Compile the whole program, generate parser to parse syntax tree.
3. make debug
	Debug mode of usage 2.
4. make splc
	Make syntax tree generator and grammar analyzer together.
	In this case, the output isn't the syntax tree, but the result
	of grammar analyzer.
	To be notice, if there isn't any error(s), the output would
	be empty.
5. make clean
	Remove all the files generated by make.

Requirements:
1. gcc compiler
2. flex
3. bison
